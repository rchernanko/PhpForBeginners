<?php

/*
 * We will add a PagesController class
 *
 * Generally speaking, a controller is responsible :
 *  - receiving a request
 *  - delegating in some form
 *  - returning a response
 *
 * Basically every file in the controllers directory (about.php, about-culture.php etc), will be deleted + its
 * logic moved into the PagesController class.
 *
 * Then we updated the information in the routes.php file.
 *
 * Now go to the Router.php file - we will amend something in the direct function
 *
 * NOTE = At point 4.43 of the video, i stopped making notes
